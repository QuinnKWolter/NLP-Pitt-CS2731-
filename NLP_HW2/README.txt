Interpersonal collaboration: Nothing assistive, moreso just saying, "Wow, look at this!" to a friend and ruminating on the absolute nuttiness and absurdity of some of these captions in the SNLI corpus.

Generative AI usage: Cursor IDE 4o-mini model used for splitting some sequential __main__ function content into a conditional structure.

No issues or problems. Thank you again for your time and effort!
